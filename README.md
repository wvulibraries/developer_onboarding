# Developer Onboarding

The goal of this repository is to provide resources for new developers at the WVU Libraries.

This resource was forked from: [Norte Dame's Hesburgh Library](https://github.com/ndlib/developer_onboarding)

## Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Your text editor is a personal experience and something to consider.
It is also something you should be prepared to invest energy in learning more about.

At the WVU Libraries the following text editors are used:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Vi](http://www.vim.org/)


Emacs and Vi(m) are primarily used for editing files on linux servers, but are
completely capable editors on the desktop as well. If you don't have experience
with `vim` or `Emacs` they are harder tools to learn.

However `vim` and `Emacs` is available on every remote machine that you would
log into at WVU Libraries. At some point you'll want a passing familiarity with
either `vim` or `Emacs`. There are extensive plugins.

Atom is a great choice as it is open-source and free.
It is built on web technologies (i.e. HTML, CSS, and JS).
There are extensive plugins / often under rapid and perhaps volatile development.
Atom is also cross platform, available on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Sublime Text is under active development but is not open-source nor free.
We can get a license if you are interested. There are extensive plugins.

Notepad++ is a syntax highlighting text editor for Windows.

### Font

Font is an often over looked piece of your development enviornment. Be sure to choose a monospaced, serif, font.

* [10 Programming Fonts](http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts/)
* [Programming Fonts](http://programmingfonts.org/)

* [Source Code Pro](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-code-pro) - An open source, monospace, font by adobe. Works well on Linux and macOS.
  * To install source code pro on Fedora linux (24): dnf install adobe-source-code-pro-fonts
